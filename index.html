                <p>Hello, my name is Rocco Zollo. I am a junior at Iowa State and enjoy playing smash with my roommates.</p>

                <h3>Virtual Reality Taiko Video Game</h3>
                <p>This is an ongoing project that I am working on. I studied in Japan last semester and fell in love with
                    an arcade game there called Taiko, however there exist basically none in America. So, I decided to try
                    and make one myself.

                <h3>Immaculate Line</h3>
                <p>This is a project that was just recently formulated. The idea is similar to that of the Immaculate Grid, a popular online web game involving 
                    NFL trivia. The idea of this game is similar: given a starting NFL player and ending NFL player, create a list of players to connect them, using those players'
                    respective teammates.
